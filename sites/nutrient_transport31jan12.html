<h2>Nutrient Uptake</h2>
<p>Nutrient  uptake (i.e., solute transport) is a cellular process for acquiring molecules  from the cell environment that are needed to support cell growth and  metabolism. </p>
<h2>Key Concepts </h2>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Cells require       many types of essential and non-essential nutrients.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Cells can       scavenge low abundant compounds from their environments and accumulate       them intracellularly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Two  types/classes of nutrient uptake (solute transport) are distinguished: </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Passive  transport</strong>: does not  require energy.  Passive transport occurs  either by <strong>passive diffusion</strong> across  membranes or via <strong>facilitated diffusion</strong> which is mediated by membrane intrinsic proteins.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Active  transport</strong>: requires  dedicated transporters and energy input.<strong> </strong>Transporters involved in active transport are differentiated based on their  mechanism as <strong>ABC-type transporters</strong>, <strong>symporters</strong> and <strong>antiporters</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Specific information on E. coli Nutrient  Uptake</h2>
<p><strong>I. Passive  transport across the cytoplasmic membrane</strong><br />
  <br />
  Entry of solutes into the cell via diffusion is generally  limited as the cytoplasmic membrane presents a selective hydrophobic barrier. The  driving force of simple diffusion is the solute concentration gradient across  the membrane. Here, we describe two types of diffusion processes across the  membrane that differ by whether a membrane protein assists in the  movement.  </p>
<p><strong>1. Passive  diffusion</strong>.  </p>
<p><strong>2. Facilitated  diffusion</strong></p>

<p><strong>II. Active  transport across the cytoplasmic membrane</strong> <br />
  <br />
The majority of molecules required for cell metabolism are  taken up by active transport systems. This process is carried out transporter  proteins located in the cytoplasmic membrane and always requires the  expenditure of metabolic energy in the form of ATP or the the proton motive  force. Some sugar transporters utilize the high energy compound PEP  (phosphoenylpyruvate). Active transport systems are highly specific for an  individual molecule or class of structurally related compounds. Since active  transport is driven by cell energy, it allows the cell to accumulate molecules  to high concentrations inside the cytoplasm relative to the level outside the  cell (i.e., molecules are accumulated against an increasing concentration  gradient). Finally, the synthesis and/or activity of many of these active  transport systems are regulated depending on the cellular needs.  </p>
<p><strong>Types  of Active Transport Systems</strong></p>
<p>Active transport systems are divided into three classes and  are generally named according to their mechanism of action.  In most cases the solute is merely  transported from the cell exterior to the interior cytoplasm in an unmodified  form. In a few cases the solute is chemically altered during its transport. <br />

  <strong>2. Secondary  transport systems or permeases.</strong></p>
