<h2>Anaerobic Respiration - Exercise #1</h2>
<p>You  know that <em>E. coli</em> can respire using a  variety of different electron donors. One such donor is formate, which is  oxidized by one of two formate dehydrogenases, formate dehydrogenase-H (part of  the formate hydrogen-lyase complex) and formate dehydrogenase-N.</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>You are using EcoCyc to find out what possible substrate(s) E. coli can use as electron acceptors  when formate is the electron donor? Name 3.</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>Formate dehydrogenase-N is located in the cytoplasmic  membrane with its catalytic subunits facing the periplasmic site.  Which protein secretion system translocates  FDH-N to the periplasm?</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>You specifically wish to look at formate hydrogenase-N  (Fdh-N).  Under what environmental  condition(s) is operon expressed maximally?</li>
</ol>
