<h2>Anaerobic Respiration - Exercise #1- Advanced</h2>
<p>You  are interested in the role of NADH dehydrogenase in anaerobic respiration. The  genome of<em> E. coli</em> encodes for two  NADH dehydrogenases, NDH-1 and NDH-2.  </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Since NDH-1 is a protein complex embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane,  it has a hydrophobic component.  Name the  subunit composition of the hydrophobic fragment and point out which of these  subunits binds the ubiquinone molecules.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>Name two protein(s)/molecule(s) that regulate gene expression  of the NDH-2 operon.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>NDH-1 is used during anaerobic respiration to oxidize NADH  and fumarate can act as the terminal electron acceptor.  Observing the enzymatic reaction carried out  by fumarate reductase, what is fumarate reduced to?  Does this result in any direct proton  translocation to the periplasm by the reductase?  </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>NDH-1 and NDH-2 catalyze the transfer of electrons into the  quinone pool.  Do both complexes  contribute to the electrochemical gradient?   Explain your answer.</li>
</ol>
