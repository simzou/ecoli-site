<h2>Anaerobic Respiration - Exercise #3</h2>
<p><em>E.  coli</em>  contains three lactate dehydrogenases.  One is used to ferment pyruvate to lactate  and the other two are used as electron donors in aerobic respiration.   </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Name the genes  encoding the three lactate dehydrogenases and state what process the enzyme is  involved in.</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>The <em>lldD</em> gene is part of an operon. Which  other genes are present and what is the function of their gene products?</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>Under what  environmental conditions is <em>lldD</em> repressed?  What protein(s)/molecule(s)  repress its expression?</li>
</ol>
