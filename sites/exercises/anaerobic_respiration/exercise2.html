<h2>Anaerobic Respiration - Exercise #2</h2>
<p><em>E. coli</em> can use many  different combinations of enzyme complexes to oxidize electron donors and  reduce electron acceptors.  When formate  is oxidized, DMSO reductase and nitrate reductase A can be a partner to formate  dehydrogenase in an electron transport chain.  </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Compare and contrast DMSO reductase and nitrate reductase A  in the electron transport chain with formate dehydrogenase; what is similar  what is different.</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>You are interested in how the expression of both DMSO and  nitrate reductase operons is regulated. Based on the information that you find  in EcoCyc, compare and contrast the regulation of expression of both operons.</li>
</ol>
