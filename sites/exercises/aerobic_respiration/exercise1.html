<h2>Aerobic Respiration - Exercise #1 </h2>
<p>You  are studying two different terminal oxidases found in the facultative anaerobe <em>E. coli K-12</em> strain MG1655: cytochrome <em>bo</em> oxidase and cytochrome <em>bd</em>-I oxidase.  </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Write out the full, complete enzymatic  reaction(s) these oxidases carry out.  </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>In addition, you note that the E.C. #  for cytochrome <em>bd</em>-1 terminal oxidase  differs from that of the cytochrome <em>bo</em> terminal oxidase.  What other enzyme carries  out the same enzymatic reaction as cytochrome <em>bd</em>-1 terminal oxidase?</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>Your colleague in the lab across from  you is studying the role of <em>Actinomyces</em> in dental plaque, a microaerophilic environment.  She wishes to perform a gene knockout of the  oxidase most likely to be involved in respiration during low oxygen concentrations,  but doesn’t know which genes she should start with.  Knowing that <em>E. coli</em> can survive in microaerophilic conditions through the use  of one its oxidases, you suggest she knock out the <em>Actinomyces</em> oxidase most similar to which <em>E. coli</em> oxidase?   </li>
</ol>
