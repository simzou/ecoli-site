<h2>Aerobic Respiration - Exercise #6 </h2>
<p>Your lab uses the facultative anaerobe <em>E. coli K-12</em> strain MG1655 as its model organism.  You have been asked to study some of the enzymes  involved in aerobic respiration.</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>You are specifically  looking at NADH dehydrogenase I and II (NDH-1 and NDH-2).  Upon examining their reactions, you notice  something uniquely different between the two.   What is it?  (Hint: look at their  enzymatic reaction diagram)</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>Only NDH-1 functions  under microaerophilic conditions; expression of the NDH-2 gene is repressed  when molecular oxygen levels are low.  Explain  why.   </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
