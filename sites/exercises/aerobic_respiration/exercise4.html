<h2>Aerobic Respiration - Exercise #4 </h2>
<p>Your lab uses the facultative anaerobe <em>E. coli K-12</em> strain MG1655 as its model organism.  You have been asked to compare and contrast  succinate dehydrogenase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, both of which  are used for aerobic respiration.</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Both dehydrogenase enzymes  oxidize their electron donor and donate electrons to which group of  intermediate electron carriers?  </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>In addition, what is  the subunit composition of these two enzymes?</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>Your PI suggests that  you knock out all dehydrogenase enzymes in <em>E.  coli</em> that are involved in respiration, except for Formate dehydrogenase-N  (Fdh-N).  Do you expect that your  modified strain would be able to grow in the presence of oxygen? Please  explain.  </li>
</ol>
