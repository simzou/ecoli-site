<h2>Aerobic Respiration - Exercise #3</h2>
<p>Your lab uses the  facultative anaerobe <em>E. coli K-12</em> strain MG1655 as its model organism.  You  have been asked to study the various dehydrogenases used in aerobic  environmental conditions.</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>NADH dehydrogenase II  is used to oxidize NADH during aerobic  respiration.  Name two pathways that generate  NADH.  </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>Does this dehydrogenase pump  protons to the periplasmic space?  If so,  how many protons?  If not, name the  purposes it serves. </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>The electrons from the  oxidation of NADH (by NADH dehydrogenase) are ultimately used by a reductase  complex to reduce O2 to H2O.  During aerobic respiration, would <em>E. coli</em> use Nitrate reductase,  Cytochrome <em>bo</em> oxidase or DMSO  reductase?  Explain briefly.   </li>
</ol>
