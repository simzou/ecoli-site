<h2>Aerobic Respiration - Exercise #5 </h2>
<p>Your lab uses the facultative anaerobe <em>E. coli K-12</em> strain MG1655 as its model organism.  You have been asked to study some of the  enzymes involved in aerobic respiration.</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Both succinate  dehydrogenase and NADH dehydrogenase I (NDH-1) transfer electrons from their  oxidized substrate to the ubiquinone pool.   Name two of the main possible terminal reductases that can receive the  electrons and the environmental condition(s) that has to be present for each  reductase. </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>Name the substrate(s) and product(s) for each  terminal reductase.</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>Name the regulatory  proteins that control expression of the succinate dehydrogenase operon; which  of these regulators ensure optimal expression of the operon under aerobic  conditions?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
