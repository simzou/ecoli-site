<h2>Aerobic Respiration - Exercise #2</h2>
<p>Your  lab uses the facultative anaerobe <em>E. coli  K-12</em> strain MG1655 as its model organism.   You have been asked to determine which terminal cytochrome oxidases are  used in varying environmental conditions.</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Which cytochrome terminal oxidase(s)  are used during microaerophilic conditions?   Which oxidase(s) are used during high oxygen concentrations? </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <li>Please list which <strong><u>genes</u></strong> encode the two different <strong><u>subunit 1</u></strong>s of the terminal oxidases. </li>
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <li>You wish to further study the  regulation of the two cytochrome oxidases operons.  You notice that Fructose-1-phosphate regulates  the cytochrome <em>bo</em> oxidase operons.  Explain how it acts and how that affects <em>bo</em> oxidase operon expression. </li>
</ol>
