<h2>Nutrient Transport - Exercise #4 </h2>
<p><strong>You are  studying nutrient uptake in <em>E. coli</em> and are curious about the gene <em>adiC</em>,  which encodes a protein that is involved in nutrient uptake.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
 <li>What molecule(s) does this protein uptake transport  into the cytosol and/or periplasmic space?   Establish what category (Passive Diffusion, Facilitated Diffusion,  Active Transport).  Establish what class  (Ion Driven - be specific, Group Translocation, ABC Transporter) of  transporters it belongs to.  What energy  source, if any, drives the uptake process?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>What is the affinity of this  transporter for its transported molecule(s)?  </li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Is the transcription  of the transporter gene regulated?  If so, what protein(s) regulate it?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Is this transporter important for  survival in very acidic or very basic environments?  How does the cell counteract acidification or  basification? (I.e., what reaction must occur?)</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>When viewing the transport diagram, where is the  transporter located?  How many membrane  spanning regions does it have (Hint:   Look at the Sequence Features diagram)?</li>
</ol>
