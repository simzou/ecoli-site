<h2>Nutrient Transport - Advanced Exercise 2</h2>
<p>EnvZ and OmpR proteins play a key role in regulating the transcription of genes encoding outer membrane porins in <em>E. coli</em>. </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>What type of regulation system do these proteins form, and which type of protein in that system is EnvZ? </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>What stretch of residues is necessary for ATP binding in EnvZ? </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>What is the mechanism of autophosophorylation of EnvZ considering that it forms a dimer, and which amino acid is phosphorylated? (Hint: Find the reaction page for the autophosphorylation.)</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>EnvZ phosphorylates OmpR. What resets this regulatory system, i.e. what converts OmpR back to its unphosphorylated state?Â  (Hint: refer to the associated Reaction page.) </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>Under &ldquo;Sequence Features&rdquo; for EnvZ, what amino acid at position 347 was mutated? What was it mutated to? How would porin expression be impacted by this mutation?</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>What mutations in OmpR would give a similar phenotype to that described in your answer to e? Give your answer in terms of general domains rather than specific amino acids. </li>
</ol>
