<h2>Nutrient Transport - Exercise #5</h2>
<p><strong>You are  studying nutrient uptake in <em>E. coli</em> and are curious about a transporter that transports putrescine and  ornithine.  The gene for this transporter  is <em>potE</em>.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
 <li>What molecule(s) does this transporter transport  into the cytosol and/or periplasmic space?   Establish what category (Passive Diffusion, Facilitated Diffusion,  Active Transport).  Establish what  class/classes (Ion Driven - be specific, Group Translocation, ABC Transporter)  of transporters it belongs to.  What energy  source(s), if any, drives the uptake process?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>What is the affinity of this transporter for its  transported molecule(s)?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Is the transcription of the transporter gene  regulated?  If so, what protein(s)  regulate it?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Which two amino acid residues (sequence number and  amino acid) are thought to be responsible for putrescine uptake?  </li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Is this gene part  of an operon?  If so, what other gene(s)  is/are in the operon?  Give the gene  function also, if applicable (Hint: click on the genome browser)</li>
</ol>
