<h2>Nutrient Transport - Exercise #7</h2>
<p><strong> You are studying nutrient uptake in <em>E. coli</em> and are curious about the PutP  transporter (encoded by the <em>putP</em> gene).</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
 <li>What  molecule(s) does this transporter transport into the cytosol and/or periplasmic  space?  Establish what category (Passive  Diffusion, Facilitated Diffusion, Active Transport).  Establish what class (Ion Driven - be  specific, Group Translocation, ABC Transporter) of transporters it belongs to.  What energy source, if any, drives the uptake  process?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>What is the affinity of this transporter for its transported  molecule(s)?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Is  the transcription of the transporter gene regulated?  If so, what protein(s) regulate it?  If regulated, how many DNA regulatory sites  total (for the promoter) are there?   (Hint:  Look at the &ldquo;Transcription  Units&rdquo; diagram)</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>When  viewing the transport diagram, where is the transporter localized? How many  membrane-spanning regions does it have?   On what side of the cytoplasmic membrane are the N and C termini  located?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Which  amino acid residue (sequence number and full name) is responsible for binding  sodium and proline?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Is  this gene part of an operon?  If so, what  other gene(s) is/are in the operon?  Give  the gene(s) function also, if applicable (Hint:   click on the genome browser)</li>
</ol>
