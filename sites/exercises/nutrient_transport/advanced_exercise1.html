<h2>Nutrient Transport - Advanced Exercise 1</h2>
<p>LamB facilitates diffusion of maltose and similar sugars across the outer membrane. </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>The Transcription Units diagram on the &ldquo;Transporter:phage lambda receptor protein&rdquo; page shows <em>lamB </em>is part of an operon with <em>malK</em> and <em>malM</em>. What does <em>malK</em> encode? Why do you think LamB is synthesized together with MalK and MalM? Describe the scenario in which these proteins work together in maltose transport.</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>Schrimer et al. (1995) made a crystallographic evaluation of LamB in complex with maltose. What type of amino acids in LamB were found in that study to be necessary to compose the channel? </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>Now find these residues within the Sequence Features diagram for the LamB sequence itself--remember that they need to be labeled as important for sugar transport. List all of them. </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>If you deleted the gene encoding LamB from <em>E. coli</em>, would drug resistance be impacted? If so, how? Hint: Look at related reference abstracts. How could you counter this phenotype genetically without complementing the mutant strain with the <em>lamB</em> gene? </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>Use the Gene-Reaction Schematic to name another protein that can bring maltose from the external environment to the periplasmic space. </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>Although not much is known about the function of MalM, the Summary Section states it has a signal peptide.Â  Why would this protein need a signal peptide?</li>
