<h2>Nutrient Transport - Exercise #2</h2>
<p><strong>You are studying nutrient uptake in <em>E. coli</em> and are curious about the role  of the TrkH transporter.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
 <li>What molecule(s) does this transporter  transport into the cytosol and/or periplasmic space?  Establish what category (Passive Diffusion,  Facilitated Diffusion, Active Transport).   Establish what class (Ion Driven - be specific, Group Translocation, ABC  Transporter) of transporters it belongs to.   What energy source, if any, drives the uptake process?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>What is the affinity of this  transporter for its transported molecule(s)?  </li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Is the transcription of the  transporter gene regulated?  If so, what  protein(s) regulate it?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Is the transport activity of TrkH regulated  by any protein(s) and/or molecule(s)?   Explain.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>When viewing the transport diagram, where  is the transporter localized?  How many  transmembrane helices does it have (Hint:   Look at the Sequence Features diagram)?</li>
</ol>
