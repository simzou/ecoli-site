<h2>Nutrient Transport - Exercise #9</h2>
<p><strong>You are  studying nutrient uptake in <em>E. coli</em> and are curious about the Fe3+ ABC transporter.  You know that <em>fecB</em> is one of the five genes responsible for this ABC transporter.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
 <li>What are  the other three genes that make up this particular iron ABC transporter?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>What are  the functions of all four genes (be sure to mention what they bind &amp; their  affinity/affinities or what reaction they catalyze, if anything!)?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Do the four  genes form  an operon?  If in an operon, are there any additional  genes (other than the four named)?  Name  and describe function(s).</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Describe  the regulation Fe3+ uptake genes. Is this ABC transporter inducible  or not?  If so, name what compound and/or  condition induces expression of the genes.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>What is the  molecular weight of FecB?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
