<h2>Nutrient Transport - Exercise #6 </h2>
<p><strong>You are studying nutrient  uptake in <em>E. coli</em> and are curious  about the transporter encoded by the gene <em>nupC</em>.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
 <li>What is the name of this transporter and what  nucleoside(s) does this transporter transport into the cytosol and/or  periplasmic space?  Establish what  category (Passive Diffusion, Facilitated Diffusion, Active Transport).  Establish what class (Ion Driven - be  specific, Group Translocation, ABC Transporter) of transporters it belongs  to.  What energy source, if any, drives  the uptake process?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Is the transcription of the transporter gene regulated?  If so, what protein(s)/ molecule(s) regulate  it?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>When viewing the transport diagram, where is the  transporter located?  How many transmembrane  helices does it have (Hint:  Look at the  Sequence Features diagram)?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Why would the cell import nucleosides?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>What sigma factor is required for binding RNA  polymerase to the promoter for transcription initiation?</li>
</ol>
