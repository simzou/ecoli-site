<h2>Nutrient Transport - Exercise #3 </h2>
<p><strong>You are studying nutrient uptake in <em>E. coli</em> and are curious about the MgtA  transporter.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
 <li>What molecule(s) does this transporter  transport into the cytosol and/or periplasmic space?  Establish what category (Passive Diffusion,  Facilitated Diffusion, Active Transport).   Establish what class (Ion Driven - be specific, Group Translocation, ABC  Transporter) of transporters it belongs to.   What energy source, if any, drives the uptake process?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>What is the affinity of this transporter  for its transported molecule(s)?  </li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Is the transcription of the  transporter gene regulated?  If so, what  protein(s) regulate it?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Is the transport activity of MgtA  regulated by any protein(s) and/or molecule(s)?   Explain.</li>
</ol>
