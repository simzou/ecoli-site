<h2>Nutrient Transport - Exercise #8</h2>
<p><strong>You are  studying nutrient uptake in <em>E. coli</em> and are curious about the nickel ABC transporter.  You know that <em>nikA</em> is one of the five genes responsible for this ABC transporter.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
 <li>What are  the other four genes that make up this particular nickel ABC transporter?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>What are  the functions of all five genes (be sure to mention what they bind &amp; their  affinity/affinities or what reaction they catalyze, if anything!)?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Are the  five genes in an operon together?  If so,  is this operon regulated?  Explain.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Name one  compound that represses transcription of of these ABC transporter genes.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>State which  amino acid region(s) of the ATP binding protein binds ATP.</li>
</ol>
