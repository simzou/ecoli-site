<h2>Nutrient Transport - Exercise #11</h2>
<p><strong>You are  studying nutrient uptake in <em>E. coli</em> and are curious about the high affinity molybdate ABC transporter.  You know that ModB is one of the components  of this particular ABC transporter.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
 <li>What are the other two genes that encode other components of the  molybdate ABC transporter?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>What are the functions of all three genes (be sure to mention what they  bind &amp; their affinity/affinities or what reaction they catalyze, if  anything!)?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Are the three genes part of an operon?   Explain.  </li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Is the expression of these genes (or operon, depending on your answer to  the question above) regulated?  Explain.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>For the periplasmic binding component of this ABC Transporter, what  region of amino acids is responsible for binding molybdate?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Give the E.C.# for the enzymatic reaction this transporter carries  out.  How many subunits of each protein  are required for the enzymatic reaction to occur?</li>
</ol>
