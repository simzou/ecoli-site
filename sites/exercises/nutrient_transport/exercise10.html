<h2>Nutrient Transport - Exercise #10</h2>
<p><strong>You are  studying nutrient uptake in <em>E. coli</em> and are curious about the ABC transporter responsible for inorganic phosphate  uptake.  You know that <em>pstA</em> is one of the four genes  responsible for producing ABC transporter.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
 <li>What are  the other three genes that make up this particular phosphate ABC transporter?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>What are  the functions of all four genes (be sure to mention what they bind &amp; their  affinity/affinities or what reaction they catalyze, if anything!)?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Do the four  genes form an operon?  Explain.  </li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Is the  expressioon of these genes (or operon, depending on your answer to the question  above) regulated?  Explain.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Is this ABC  Transporter inducible or not?  If so,  name what compound and/or condition induces expression of the genes.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Write out  the complete enzymatic reaction of this phosphate transporter.  How many molecules of phosphate end up in the  cytosol?</li>
</ol>
