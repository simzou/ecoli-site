<h2>Nutrient Transport - Exercise #12</h2>
<p><strong>You are  studying the PTS system in <em>E. coli</em> and know that mannitol is one of the sugars brought in by this transport  system.  You also know that <em>mtlA</em> plays an important role in mannitol  transport and wish to know more about it.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
 <li>What does <em>mtlA</em> encode?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>How many domains does mtlA have?   What is the name of each? Where is each domain localized to?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Is the <em>mtlA</em> gene ipart of an operon?  If so, what other genes (and their associated  functions) are there?  </li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>Is the  expression of these genes (or operon, depending on your answer to the question  above) regulated?  Explain.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <li>After  mannitol enters the cell through this PTS system, what is it modified to?  How is the inorganic molecule transferred to  the sugar?</li>
</ol>
