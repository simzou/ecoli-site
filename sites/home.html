<h2 id="contenthead">Welcome to the <em>E. coli</em> Student Portal</h2>
<div id="contentbody">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Escherichia  coli</em> K-12 strain  MG1655 has a fully sequenced genome. The genomic blueprint reveals insight into  all metabolic and catabolic aspects of this leading model organism. It also  provides a paradigm to understand other bacteria.</p>
<p>The <em>E. coli</em> Student Portal is learning and  teaching site, which leads students in understanding the metabolic capabilities  of <em>E. coli</em> by exploring the EcoCyc  database.</p>
<p>The <em>E. coli</em> Student Portal provides:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>student-oriented, educational materials for learning microbiology concepts <u></u></li>
  <li>tutorials to understand and use EcoCyc <u></u></li>
  <li>exercises to test understanding microbiology       concepts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is <em>EcoCyc</em>?</strong> <em>EcoCyc</em> is a scientific  database for the bacterium <em>Escherichia coli</em> K-12 strain MG1655. It  contains information regarding the genome, all genes, proteins, metabolites,  metabolic pathways, and transcriptional regulators. </p>
<p>Enjoy the  Student Portal at you own pace or launch into <a href="http://ecocyc.org/">EcoCyc</a> directly.</p>
