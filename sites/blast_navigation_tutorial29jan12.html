<h2>BLAST SEARCH</h2>
<p><strong>I. Introduction</strong></p>
<p>When  scientists discover a novel gene or protein, their ability to understand the  structure, function, and evolutionary lineage associated with that protein is  greatly assisted by the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). First  published in 1990 by Altschul et al., BLAST is a computer algorithm that looks  for the degree of similarity between an input DNA or protein sequence (the  query) and the numerous sequences stored in a database or set of databases.  Instead of trying to align the whole query sequence with an entire sequence  from the database (a &ldquo;global alignment&rdquo;), BLAST looks for matches between  portions of the query and portions of a database sequence to build a &ldquo;local  alignment.&rdquo; (This is analogous to searching the Internet using Google. If one  were to type a very long sentence into Google, one would get fewer results than  if a few short words were typed in.) This is incredibly advantageous to the  study of proteins, as proteins with similar functions generally share similar  domains while remaining divergent in sequence when considered as a whole. This  module explores the practical basics needed to use this invaluable tool for  bioinformatics. <br />

<p><strong>III. Types of BLAST  Commonly Used in Biology</strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>BLASTn</strong> (nucleotide-to-nucleotide).  </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>BLASTp</strong> (protein-to-protein).  </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>BLASTx</strong> (translated       nucleotide-to-protein).  </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>tBLASTn</strong> (protein-to-translated nucleotide).  </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>tBLASTx</strong> (translated       nucleotide-to-translated nucleotide). </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>IV. Performing a  BLAST Search in EcoCyc</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://biocyc.org/blast.html">EcoCyc  BLAST</a> program can be directly accessed on EcoCyc using the Search  pull-down menu at the top left of any EcoCyc page. </p>
<p>Paste  nucleotide or protein query sequence in <u>FASTA</u> format into the  search window</p>
<p>Select:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>query type as either a nucleotide       or protein query </li>
  <li>database search as nucleotide or       protein database </li>
  <li>program (button can perform any       of the six BLAST searches listed above)</li>
</ul>
<p><u>FASTA</u> : each nucleotide or amino acid sequence is preceded by a greater than (&gt;)  symbol</p>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Change organisms for which  the search is performed  in the corner of the page under the       Quick Search field (&ldquo;Searching Escherichia coli K-12 substr. MG1655&rdquo; is       the default). </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Advanced users can adjust the       sensitivity of the BLAST search by changing the &ldquo;Expectation Value       Threshold,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll only need to use the standard of 10 for the Exercises       provided in this module. Paste in your sequence and hit &ldquo;Search&rdquo;—you&rsquo;ll       see a report much like this one for a BLASTp search.</li>
